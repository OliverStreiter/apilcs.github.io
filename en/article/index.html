For more than a thousand years Chinese Buddhists have considered Mount Putuo to be the abode of the Bodhisattva Guanyin and the island was and is one of the most popular pilgrimage sites in China. Its many visitors have left numerous notes, poems and travelogues that describe the island from the 12th to the 18th century. These texts are collected in a series of so-called temple or mountain gazetteers (<em>sizhi</em> <span class="zh">寺志</span>/ <em>shanzhi</em> <span class="zh">山志</span>). For the last decades of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), however, there is a lack of Chinese accounts. Not quite coincidentally, as this article will argue, it is around this time that foreigners start to visit Mount Putuo. The island is mentioned in numerous accounts by European and American travelers such as C. Gützlaff, W. Medhurst, R. Fortune, N. Rondot, É. Huc, A. Little, T. Watters, B. Laufer, and C. Kupfer. Those visitors often left descriptions that reveal a wealth of detail about life on the island at a time for which few Chinese records exist. Below we will discuss the reasons behind this constellation of sources and summarize the descriptions by foreign visitors to Mount Putuo in order to complement the record of the Putuo gazetteers.</p></blockquote><div class="article__ArticleBody-pcvbzg-1 ftBPJX"><section><header>Introduction</header> <p>For Chinese Buddhists the island of Mount Putuo <span class="zh">普陀山</span> near Ningbo <span class="zh">寧波</span> is the abode of Guanyin <span class="zh">觀音</span> (Skt.

At least since the 10<sup>th</sup> century believers went to the island site to pray and perhaps glimpse the Bodhisattva herself, who was thought to dwell in one of the steep grottoes along the picturesque shoreline. Over the centuries the site’s fortunes varied. Patronized by the imperial court during the Song and Yuan the island attracted increasing numbers of pilgrims. This changed during the early and mid Ming when Mount Putuo was closed to pilgrimage travel for almost hundred fifty years as part of various ocean embargoes (<em>haijin</em> <span class="zh">海禁</span>). It was only in the mid 16<sup>th</sup> century that the site was reopened in the wake of a general revival of Buddhism in the late Ming especially in the Jiangnan region. In the late Ming and early Qing both imperial court and local gentry supported the temples on the island and there is evidence for a lively pilgrimage scene that encouraged the expansion of monastic and other settlements into the north of the island. The Kangxi (r. 1661-1722) and Yongzheng (r. 1722-1735) emperors bestowed gifts on Mount Putuo and the monastic leadership was well connected at court. During the reign of the Qianlong emperor (r. 1735-1796), who favored Tibetan, not Chinese Buddhism, imperial patronage decreased, but Mount Putuo remained a popular pilgrimage site.</p> <p>As we will see below, in the 19<sup>th</sup> century pilgrimage to the site again declined when the Opium Wars (1839–1842 and 1856–1860) and the Taiping Civil War (1850–1864) made pilgrimage travel difficult.<sup id="ftn2:ref"><a href="#ftn2">2</a></sup> Mount Putuo was, at least in part, economically reliant on a steady flow of visitors for the upkeep of its infrastructure. The temples also owned land on neighboring islands, especially Zhoushan and Zhujiajian <span class="zh">朱家尖</span>, that was rented out to tenants.<sup id="ftn3:ref"><a href="#ftn3">3</a></sup> As such they might have been directly affected by the British invasion and occupation of Dinghai (1840-46), the main harbor of Zhoushan. Especially the Taiping civil war, in which by some estimates more people perished than in the first World War, would have impacted leisure travel in the East China Sea.<sup id="ftn4:ref"><a href="#ftn4">4</a></sup> Although neither Zhoushan nor Mount Putuo saw active fighting in the Taiping campaigns, due to the combined pressures of foreign presence on the coast and the civil war in the interior the Qing lost control over the archipelago. As a consequence piracy impacted both merchant and pilgrimage travel around Zhoushan.<sup id="ftn5:ref"><a href="#ftn5">5</a></sup> The reports by foreign travelers mention hundreds of monks and dozens of temples, but also often remark on the dilapidated state of the buildings – without, however, associating the difficult times with there own presence there.</p> <p>For most of its history visitors to Mount Putuo set out from Ningbo, entering Hangzhou Bay at Zhenhai and then following the south coast of Zhoushan Island often with a stopover at Dinghai. This route remained largely unchanged even after the introduction of steamships in the 19<sup>th</sup> century. For 1907/08 Boerschmann reports:</p> <p>[Mount Putuo] can be reached relatively easily. From Shanghai to Ningbo there are daily crossings, taking about twelve hours, on elegant and conveniently furnished steamships of French, English and also Chinese shipping lines. From the same pier in Ningpo, at which the large steamers arrive, smaller Chinese steamboats leave almost daily for the six to eight hour journey along the Ningbo River [...] via Dinghai the main city on Zhoushan […] with c.30,000 inhabitants, to its terminal at Shenjiamen [Island]. In summer, during pilgrim season, they even stop at Mount Putuo where they anchor near the coast, and one is taken to the island via small rowboats. Otherwise one takes a two to three hour trip on a sailing boat from Shenjiamen to Putuo.</p> <p>In summer the large steamships that ply the Shanghai Ningbo route sometimes make special trips to Mount Putuo that allow their passengers to stay at Mount Putuo for a whole day with enough time to visit the monasteries and take a bath at the marvelous beach on the east side of the island. The passengers are mostly European and thus the island is not unknown, it has been visited quite often, and described at times quite extensively.<sup id="ftn6:ref"><a href="#ftn6">6</a></sup></p> <p>These “at times quite extensive” descriptions form an important group of sources for our knowledge about this pilgrimage site, especially during the 19<sup>th</sup> century.</p></section><div class="section-divider__SectionDividerContainer-sc-194f6qw-0 fLOyln"><span></span><span></span></div> <section><header>Lack of Chinese sources vs. abundance of Western accounts</header> <p>Difficult times often leave their trace in the sources by an absence. The Putuo gazetteer of 1832 was not too well researched, but nevertheless offers some information about Mount Putuo under Qianlong (1735-1796) and Jiaqing (1796-1820). The next Putuo gazetteer was compiled in 1924, but lacks information about the mid 19<sup>th</sup> century, because Chinese sources for the mid 19<sup>th</sup> century about Putuo were scarce. Consequently, the most recent Putuo gazetteer of 1999, although carefully researched, was not able to reconstruct even the exact succession of abbots of the main temples for the years between 1830 and 1875.<sup id="ftn7:ref"><a href="#ftn7">7</a></sup> Another notable absence is the lack of miracle stories for this period.<sup id="ftn8:ref"><a href="#ftn8">8</a></sup> Still another lacunae are travelogues. For the time before the 20<sup>th</sup> century the 1999 Putuo gazetteer includes travelogues by the following authors:</p> Name Date of visit Xu Jing <span class="zh">徐兢</span> <strong>1123</strong>-06-28 Shi Hao <span class="zh">史浩</span> between <strong>1148</strong>-03-29/04-26 Liu Geng <span class="zh">劉賡</span> <strong>1298</strong>, 1299, and 1300 Wu Lai <span class="zh">吳萊</span> <strong>1324</strong>-06-30/07-29 [First Lacunae] Hou Jigao <span class="zh">侯繼高</span> <strong>1588</strong>-03-30 Tu Long <span class="zh">屠隆</span> ~1585-<strong>1589</strong> Yin Yingyuan <span class="zh">尹應元</span> <strong>1603</strong>-06-23 Lu Bao <span class="zh">陸寶</span> <strong>1617</strong>-03-20/27 Zhu Guozhen <span class="zh">朱國禎</span> early June <strong>1617</strong> Zhang Dai <span class="zh">張岱</span> late March, early April <strong>1638</strong> Shi Shibiao <span class="zh">施世驃</span> autumn- winter <strong>1701</strong> Lao Zhibian <span class="zh">勞之辨</span> <strong>1713</strong>-03-11/16 [Second Lacunae] Gao Henian <span class="zh">高鶴年</span> <strong>1898</strong> <p>While the 250 years that passed between the travel reports of Wu Lai and Hou Jigao are due to the forced closure of the site during the early and mid-Ming, the reasons for the gap between Lao Zhibian and Gao Henian are more difficult to ascertain.</p> <p>One explanation might be simply that there were indeed no new travelogues about Mount Putuo during much of the 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> centuries, although the travelogue genre enjoyed great popularity in that time.<sup id="ftn9:ref"><a href="#ftn9">9</a></sup></p> <p>Another explanation might be that editorial dynamics prevented the inclusion and production of travelogues on Mount Putuo. The editors of the 1832 gazetteer were not much concerned with updating the record of travelogues and have not added much beyond the earlier gazetteer (compiled in 1740). This, however, would explain only the absence of Chinese travelogues for the period until 1832, not for the 19<sup>th</sup> century, as the 1924 gazetteer that should have listed these, was compiled with great care. Thus, if we lack Chinese travelogues for the period (in spite of an ever increasing output of travelogues overall), it is probably because fewer literati were interested in Mount Putuo and/or able to travel there.</p> <p>The dearth of Chinese travelogues for 19<sup>th</sup> century Mount Putuo coincides, however, with a large number of reports by European and American travelers, missionaries, scholars, and adventurers, who described their sojourns to the sacred site. Among the most prominent were:<sup id="ftn10:ref"><a href="#ftn10">10</a></sup></p> Name Date of visit Karl F. A.

As several sources (Nevius, Arène, Edkins) attest, already in the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century the island had become a popular bathing resort for the foreign community in Shanghai and Zhejiang. This fame lasted into the early decades of the 20<sup>th</sup> century when the third edition of Crow’s <em>Traveller’s Handbook to China</em> says of Mount Putuo: “Among foreigners living in Shanghai it is known as the nearest bathing beach, to Chinese Buddhists it is the most sacred place in East China.”<sup id="ftn14:ref"><a href="#ftn14">14</a></sup></p> <p>Mount Putuo owed its prominence among foreigners in large part to its central location along China’s coast. It was accessible for the foreign communities that sprang up along the coast in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, especially from the treaty ports of Shanghai and Ningbo. Travel into the interior of China was difficult for both missionaries and traders during the 19<sup>th</sup> century, because of legal restrictions, rebellions and civil war. Ocean travel along the coast, on the other hand, was comparatively easy. Among expatriates in late 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> century China, Mount Putuo was among the best known Buddhist sites. Not coincidentally therefore, Mount Putuo was discussed in great detail in two early 20<sup>th</sup> century publications that introduced the site to a foreign readership.<sup id="ftn15:ref"><a href="#ftn15">15</a></sup></p></section><div class="section-divider__SectionDividerContainer-sc-194f6qw-0 fLOyln"><span></span><span></span></div> <section><header>Foreigners on Mount Putuo</header> <p>It was not love on first sight, however. The first two visitors, Gützlaff and Medhurst, who left a description of Mount Putuo were Protestant missionaries. While acknowledging the picturesque landscape, they felt entitled to express their disgust about the religious character of the island.<sup id="ftn16:ref"><a href="#ftn16">16</a></sup> Gützlaff does not mince his words:</p> <p>A temple built on a projecting rock, beneath which the foaming sea dashed, gave us some idea of the genius of its inhabitants, in thus selecting the most attractive spot to celebrate the orgies of idolatry. … Though we were in a dark hall, standing before the largest image of Budha [sic], there was nothing impressive; even our English sailors were disgusted with the scene. … No females are allowed to live on the island, nor are there any laymen suffered to reside here, unless they be in the service of the priests. To maintain this numerous train of idlers, lands on the opposite island have been allotted for their use, which they farm out; but as this is still inadequate, they go upon begging expeditions not only into surrounding provinces, but even as far as Siam.<sup id="ftn17:ref"><a href="#ftn17">17</a></sup></p> <p>Medhurst too was disgusted with the Buddhist presence on the island:</p> <p>All the aids that could be collected from nature and art, were there concentrated, to render the scene lovely and enchanting. But to the eye of the Christian philanthropist, it presented on melancholy picture of moral and spiritual death. Viewed by the light of revelation, and in the prospect of eternity, the whole island of Putuo, with its picturesque scenery, its hundreds temples, and its six thousand priests, exhibited to the mind nothing but a useless waste of property, a gross misemployment of time, and a pernicious fostering of error, tending to corrupt the surrounding population, and to draw off their minds from the worship of the true God, the adoration of the phantom Buddha... On all sides, we were gratified by perceiving marks of decay, in the temples and adjacent buildings; and earnestly hope, that future travellers will find these worse than useless structures level with the ground; and the lazy drones who inhabit them, scattered abroad, or employed in promoting the welfare and intelligence of their fellow countrymen.<sup id="ftn18:ref"><a href="#ftn18">18</a></sup></p> <p>Thus the first descriptions of Mount Putuo by Europeans are filled with the gentle spirit of Christian mission in the Far East. The reason why Gützlaff and Medhurst visited at all was in order to “distribute good books for their [the monks’] instruction and benefit” (Medhurst 1838: 487). Ambling across the island’s “lovely and enchanting” landscape the missionaries were the vanguard of colonial expansion that materialized a few years later when, in July 1840, the British invaded and occupied Zhoushan. Gützlaff, by then in British employ, served for a while as the civil magistrate on Zhoushan during the occupation of the island, only a few years after his first visit there as a missionary.<sup id="ftn19:ref"><a href="#ftn19">19</a></sup></p> <p>In spite of their colonialist attitude, our twisted sources yield useful information. That women, for instance, were forbidden to spend the night on Mount Putuo has often been repeated in Western sources about Putuo, but does not appear in gazetteers of the period. It was independently observed by Fortune in 1844 (Fortune 1847: 184), Little in 1875 (Little 1910: 178), and DuBose in c.1880 (DuBose 1886: 277), thus the policy must have been in place for some decades. The <em>Imperial Gazetteer</em>of 1855, an encyclopedia of the world’s geography as owned and desired by the British Empire, has an entry on Mount Putuo that draws on the accounts of Gützlaff and Medhurst. It says:</p> <p>It [Mt. Putuo] is almost literally covered with monasteries, pavilions, temples, and other buildings appropriated to religious uses; besides grottoes, and other monuments of superstition, in which at least 2000 idle priests chant the praises of their idols, and live in ignorance, idolatry, vice, and dirt. No females are allowed to reside on Putuo, nor any besides priests, unless in their employ.<sup id="ftn20:ref"><a href="#ftn20">20</a></sup></p> <p>Not all early travelers to Mount Putuo were Christian supremacists and the reports by the Scottish botanist R. Fortune and the economist N. Rondot, who was part of a French expedition, were less harsh in their judgment of religion on the island. Both provide a wealth of detail about the site including its religious practices. Rondot, for example, included what is perhaps the first extensive retelling of the Miaoshan legend in a Western language (Rondot 1847: 164-171) as well as descriptions of monastic garb and ritual (<em>ibid.</em>: 161-162).</p> <p>Fortune was informed,</p> <p>that the resident priests were fond of collecting plants, particularly Orchidacese, and that their collections were much increased by the itinerant habits of the begging priests, who visit the most distant provinces of the empire, as well as by the donations of the lay devotees, who come to Putuo at stated seasons of the year, to worship and leave their offerings in the temples.<sup id="ftn21:ref"><a href="#ftn21">21</a></sup></p> <p>The Catholic priest Évariste Huc, a member of the Vincentian order, was much milder in his assessment of Buddhism on Mount Putuo. Huc had, compared to the Ningbo missionaries, traveled far and wide in China, Tibet and Mongolia. He too considered Chinese Buddhism in decline, especially when he compared it to Tibetan Buddhism that he had encountered in Tibet and Mongolia. Nevertheless, as his account of Mount Putuo shows, he sought contact with monks and appreciated their politeness.<sup id="ftn22:ref"><a href="#ftn22">22</a></sup></p> <p>After the Opium War resulted in the establishment of the first treaty ports, a growing number of missionaries descended on Ningbo. Until 1851, 15 Protestant missionaries of different denominations had settled in Ningbo, many bringing their families with them.<sup id="ftn23:ref"><a href="#ftn23">23</a></sup> Among then were John L. and Helen S. C. Nevius, American Presbyterian missionaries that stayed in China for almost 40 years (1854-1893). Their first years were spend in Ningbo, from where they visited Mount Putuo. John Nevius spend his first summer there in company of a friend 1854. An excerpt from his diary:</p> <p>Island of Putuo, Zhoushan Archipelago, sixty miles from Ningbo, August 16, 1854: Last week Mr. Cobbold, of the Church Missionary Society, having determined to take a trip to Putuo. on account of his health, kindly invited me to accompany him. As I have been closely confined to my work and needed a little change, I accepted his invitation, and soon found myself very much in the spirit of going. . . . We started with the tide at 7 p.m., and arrived at the mouth of the river about ten and anchored for the night. As the tide was just changing, Mr. Cobbold and I enjoyed a fine swim before going to bed. Yesterday at ten in the forenoon we reached the island of Zhoushan. . . . This morning, after all sorts of detentions from wind and tide and incompetent boatmen, we arrived at Putuo and anchored some distance from shore. There was, fortunately, a small boat close by, which took us off. We started at once for a walk up the hill behind the nearest temple, and on to the northern side of the island, enjoying many beautiful views from the summits of the hill. We visited the immense boulder which rests on a very slight foundation, scarcely bigger than a thimble.<sup id="ftn24:ref"><a href="#ftn24">24</a></sup> Several of the priests from an adjoining monastery following us, Mr. Cobbold had an opportunity of speaking to them of the folly of idolatry. They assented to all he said, but no doubt it seemed foolishness to them. The sun broke through the mist and we hastened back. I took shelter in a monastery, and Mr. Cobbold went to our boat He soon returned, bringing some food for our lunch, and also books and writing-materials. Having no bed or lounge, I was glad to lie down upon two tables furnished me by a priest, to get a little rest. After occupying them an hour or so, I left them to write, and I presume Mr. Cobbold has now appropriated them.</p> <p>Thursday: After breakfast this morning we followed the beach to the right until we passed the first monastery, and from there on to another near a very deep cave. . . . From there we went to ‘Tunbridge Wells,’ where there is another natural cave, and rocks piled up in a very fantastic manner. We found in the adjoining monastery a man from Shanghai who has taken temporary vows upon himself. He was very talkative, and somewhat intelligent. There was also a good-natured old priest, who had nothing to say, but assented to everything that was said to him. And there was another, a stupefied, besotted fellow, who sat in a little nook conning an old book, looking up and grinning at us occasionally. I procured a string of beads — a rosary — from the talkative Shanghai man, and the good-humored priest presented me with another. . . . When we reached the top of Veh-ting-san [<span class="place-name">Fodingshan <span class="zh">佛頂山</span></span>] we found ourselves in the clouds, which were driving over the top, and the air was very cold. As we were thinly dad, and warm with climbing, we quickly started back. We got to our boat at seven o&#x27;clock, and the boatman at once shoved off and we started for Zhoushan, which place we reached about midnight ... I have been out of sorts ever since leaving home; still I have enjoyed the trip and hope to visit Putuo again.<sup id="ftn25:ref"><a href="#ftn25">25</a></sup></p> <p>His wish was fulfilled when in the following two summers he visited Putuo again, this time with Helen, his newly betrothed wife. To Helen we owe the first account of Mount Putuo by a woman:</p> <p>Putuo is devoted exclusively to the Buddhists; having four large temples with monasteries attached, and not far from a hundred smaller ones. The number of priests is variously estimated from seven or eight hundred, to several thousands. I believe it is more than eight hundred years since this island was first devoted to religious purposes; and some of the buildings were constructed at that time. Others again are of much more recent date, but all, even the newest, have a dilapidated, faded appearance, which indicates a great falling off in resources, as well as in the devotion of the people generally to the Buddhist religion.... Adjoining this is a lotus pond, which, though not what it once was, is still very pretty. It is crossed by an arched stone bridge. There are numerous other buildings, — some used as temples for the idols, and some as sleeping places for the lazy, stupid priests, who doze away their lives in this pretty retreat. Had they a spark of energy or ambition, they would make some effort to rescue these buildings from the decay and ruin in which we now find them.... Our rooms were not in the Sien-z [<span class="zh">前寺</span>], but at the Heo-z [<span class="zh">後寺</span>],<sup id="ftn26:ref"><a href="#ftn26">26</a></sup> about a mile further on. ... On three sides of our large room were windows, looking towards the sea, the Sien-z, and the Heo-z, of the latter of which our building formed part. .... One reason for our coming to the Heo-z, rather than either of the other temples nearer the landing, was its proximity to a sandy beach which was a capital bathing-place.<sup id="ftn27:ref"><a href="#ftn27">27</a></sup> Some years before this, an English chaplain had lost his life while bathing on this beach; having ventured, I suppose, to an unsafe distance. Thus on our guard against possible danger, we had many refreshing baths. As several other families from Ningbo were also at Putuo, we planned some delightful picnics and rambles in company to various points of interest. During the summer, years ago, it was very customary for foreigners from Ningbo and Shanghai to visit this island; but of late such visits seem nearly discontinued. Since the opening of Japan, and of other parts of China, by the recent treaties, foreigners, in choosing summer resorts, have generally given the preference to places situated in more northern latitudes, or more accessible.<sup id="ftn28:ref"><a href="#ftn28">28</a></sup></p> <p>The <em>Sien-z</em> (=<em>Qiansi</em>)<em></em> or “Front Temple,” today the <span class="place-name">Puji Temple <span class="zh">普濟寺</span></span>, was the older of the two main temples of Mount Putuo. Helen’s memoirs <em>Our Life in China</em>includes a sketch she must have drawn at one of her visits 1855-56:</p> <p><header>Figure 1: Helen Nevius 1869: Page facing p. 46. Public Domain.</header> <header>Figure 2: John Thomson 1874: Vol. 3, Plate VII-15. Scanned image from the original plates: CC License (Wellcome Trust)</header></p> <p>A photo of the lake before the Puji Temple was taken from the spot some 15 years later by John Thomson, one of the first photographers who traveled to China, and must have visited Mount Putuo 1870 or 1871. This might be the earliest photo of Mount Putuo.<sup id="ftn29:ref"><a href="#ftn29">29</a></sup></p> <p>In the text accompanying the image Thomson speaks of a large community of c. 2000 monastics, which he describes unfavorably as “...lusty, lazy monks, the pious paupers who spend their years in drowsily chanting to Buddha, and who, if dirt and sloth will foster the growth of piety, must indeed be accounted hold men.”<sup id="ftn30:ref"><a href="#ftn30">30</a></sup> He also remarks on the economy of the site: “The revenues for the support of these various religious establishments are derived from three sources: the rent of church lands, the contributions of pilgrims and the labours of the mendicant priests.”<sup id="ftn31:ref"><a href="#ftn31">31</a></sup></p> <p>Among those labors was presumably to rent out rooms to foreign guests, foreign women being exempted from the prohibition against women pilgrims staying over-night. An account by Julia Hughes, the wife of an officer in the British Imperial Maritime Customs Service, who visited in summer 1879, describes the very effective catering service arranged in a Buddhist monastery, complete with meat and champagne.<sup id="ftn32:ref"><a href="#ftn32">32</a></sup></p> <p>A close friend of the Nevius’ was William Martin who, like them, stayed in China for more than forty years. His memoirs confirm again that the Ningbo missionaries visited Mount Putuo regularly during the hot summers.</p> <p>Beyond Zhoushan, to the east, and parted from it by a narrow channel, lies the sacred isle of Puto. Like lona in early times, and Mount Athos at the present day, it is exclusively an abode of monks, no native woman being allowed to live there on any pretext. This rule, however, is not enforced in the case of foreigners; and, taking our wives and children with us, we sometimes sought refuge there from the heat of Ningbo.… In the daytime we climbed the hills or bathed in the surf, and in the evening inhaled the ocean breeze while we viewed the phosphorescent waves breaking on the shore in long billows of flame.<sup id="ftn33:ref"><a href="#ftn33">33</a></sup></p> <p>The visits to “the most lovely spot in Far Cathay” (DuBose 1886: 274), however, were not altogether carefree. Apart from the dangers of the surf, the Chinese defeat in the Opium Wars had weakened government control of the Zhoushan archipelago and, as always during such periods of weakness, this allowed the rise of piracy. Between the 1840s and the 1870s the waters around Zhoushan were not entirely safe for travel, as Martin and one of his colleagues, W. A. Russell, found out when they tried to join their families on Mount Putuo.</p> <p>Going on deck, as we approached a narrow channel we saw many lights dancing over the surface of the water, and heard an occasional discharge of small arms. In a solitary place this looked suspicious; and the next moment we perceived through the twilight the outline of seven large Canton junks lying at anchor. We pursued our course, hoping to pass them unobserved, but when we were just abreast of the fleet, a boat was lowered from the side of one of the junks and gave chase. The wind had fallen, and we were soon overtaken. Springing on board, the pirates began beating our sailors to compel them to slacken sail. Turning to us, they said, <em>Pu pa pu pa</em> (“You have nothing to fear”). Our boat was lashed to the side of a large junk, and the free-booters made free with our fresh provisions — the only booty they found in our possession. The pirates were evidently disappointed. “Who are you,” they asked, “that you have no goods? As you have no opium, you are not merchants; and as you have no firearms, you are not soldiers; who and what are you?” “We are missionaries,” we quietly replied. “Missionaries!” exclaimed a handsome young man, whom we recognized as the leader of the prize crew. “You preach about Jesus — you are good men; we will not hurt you.” He then told us that he had been in a mission chapel at Whampo, near Canton, and there heard missionaries preach the gospel. Becoming communicative, he added that he and his party, thrown out of business by the outbreak of rebellion [i.e. the Taiping], had been forced to take to the sea. “It was a bad business,” he knew, “but there was no help for it.” In searching our persons for money, of which they found very little, they had stripped off my coat and taken away Russell&#x27;s shoes and watch. My own watch, or rather my wife&#x27;s, I had taken off and left at home, not wishing to risk the loss of an object which she held precious. Observing me in my shirt-sleeves, the young leader pointed to Russell and asked if we were not “all the same”? “Oh yes,” said I; “but one of your fokees (“pals”) has carried my coat away.” The young man left us and in a moment came back with the coat. The shoes, too, were restored, but not the watch; which, however, was brought to the owner for an explanation of the mode of winding and setting.<sup id="ftn34:ref"><a href="#ftn34">34</a></sup></p> <p>While the Ningbo missionaries enjoyed Mount Putuo for its scenic beauty, other travelers were looking for different assets. An interested visitor was Ferdinand von Richthofen whose descriptions of the island in <em>China - Ergebnisse eigener Reisen und darauf gegründeter Studien</em>(1877-1912) are mainly geological, with the exception of a comment on the <span class="place-name">Huiji Temple</span>:</p> <p>[At the Huiji Temple:] Here lived 23 monks in poverty and simplicity. They were just holding a procession with sombre chanting and incense-burning. Refectory and cells showed how little they desired. The monks were said to own an old library and have a reputation for clerical erudition.<sup id="ftn35:ref"><a href="#ftn35">35</a></sup></p> <p>It is only in his posthumously published diaries that we find a more detailed account of his visit to the island. It contains an interesting remark about how the fortune telling, so common to Chinese temple culture, on Mount Putuo was geared towards fishermen:</p> <p><span>From the place where we anchored we came first to a small temple, where the Europeans tend to stay. In the main temple we found some priests, one of their best sources of income is fortune telling. In a box there are some hundred lots. One draws a lot and a priest who sits in a stall, exchanges, for a small fee, the number for a printed piece of paper. We made the experiment and received some commonplace divinations which were mainly concerned with fishing. This is because the place is visited especially by fishermen who pray here and seem to consider the place as some sort of oracle. I was prophesied a lucky catch in a river. An other source of income is the sale of images of the temple deity, a map of the temples and their surroundings, a sort of rosary etc.</span> <span><sup id="ftn36:ref"><a href="#ftn36">36</a></sup></span> <span></span></p> <p>The maps mentioned by von Richhofen here (and earlier by Rondot (1847: 161)) would have been the kind of simple woodblock prints for the use of pilgrims of which some specimens have survived in libraries and museums.<sup id="ftn37:ref"><a href="#ftn37">37</a></sup> Von Richthofen’s survey of China’s geography and geology was done not merely for scientific purposes.

The harbor can be fortified easily and the navy flotilla would control the traffic with northern China and Japan. It would turn into an important center of commerce.

They do not seem to mention, for instance, the prohibition against women residing on the island which is mentioned by almost all foreign witnesses. This prohibition seems to have been in force at least for several decades during the 19<sup>th</sup> century, and was probably limited to pilgrims not the resident population of fishing folk. It is hard to imagine, however, that all women pilgrims were confined to one day visits and returned to adjacent Zhoushan by nightfall. This might be one of those prohibitions that were widely announced, but not too rigorously enforced.<sup id="ftn40:ref"><a href="#ftn40">40</a></sup> Another facet not usually emphasized by the gazetteers is that fishing communities were an important group of devotees for the religious establishments on Mount Putuo. This is mentioned by the eye-witness reports of their worship by Gutzlaff (1834: 443), Rondot (1847: 158), and von Richthofen (1907: 47).</p> <p>Also not mentioned in the gazetteers as far as I see are the Tibetan inscriptions on the island mentioned by Laufer (1909: 568) and Kupfer (1911: 62). These inscriptions, almost certainly the mantra <em>oṃ maṇi padme huṃ</em>, have vanished in the 20<sup>th</sup> century. That Mount Putuo was also visited by at least some Tibetan and Mongol Buddhists during the Qing is not in itself surprising, considering the strong Tibetan Buddhist presence in the north, in Beijing and at Mount Putuo. Nevertheless past gazetteers and the site today do not reference Tibetan Buddhism in any way – textually, epigraphically, or architecturally.</p> <p>Perhaps the most important information provided by foreign accounts pertains to the number of monks in residence. Disregarding the exaggerated figure of 6000 that is cited by Medhurst (1838: 483), most early travelers report c. 2000 monks (Gutzlaff 1834: 443, Fortune 1847: 185, Rondot 1847: 182). Against that estimates from after the Taiping wars, speak of about 1000 monks (Butler 1879: 122, DuBose 1886: 277, Boerschman 1911: 12, Johnston 1913: 316).<sup id="ftn41:ref"><a href="#ftn41">41</a></sup> If Culbertson is correct and the number of monks had fallen to 300 in 1857<sup id="ftn42:ref"><a href="#ftn42">42</a></sup> the decline must have happened after Rondot’s visit in 1847.</p> <p>Although these numbers are estimates, the discrepancy between the size of the monastic population before and after the Taiping, combined with Culbertson’s observation, indicates a drop in the monastic population in the 1850s. The main reason for the decline was probably the Taiping civil war (1850-1864), which directly or indirectly affected the movement of supplies and people all through central China and the lower Yangzi region. Qing naval forces, already expelled from Zhoushan during the British occupation, would have been ordered inland to fight the Taiping. Pirates – Martin’s “free-booters” – filled the power vacuum in the archipelago after the British left for Hong Kong, which they had exchanged for Zhoushan. The pirates interrupted pilgrimage traffic and thus affected the economy of the island. Consequently, as mentioned above, the gazetteers of Mount Putuo show a lack of information for the 19<sup>th</sup> century regarding the succession of abbots, miracle tales, and other matters for the decades around 1850. All this indicates that the Taiping civil war and to a lesser degree the short-lived British occupation of Zhoushan’s main harbor interrupted pilgrimage travel to Mount Putuo in the mid-19th century.</p> <p>The downturn was temporary. Whereas in the 1840s Abbé Huc found “the vast monasteries of Putuo, where once large numbers of monks congregated, now almost entirely abandoned to legions of rats and huge spiders,” visitors in the late 1870s saw a rejuvenated pilgrimage site. In a lecture delivered before the Ningpo Book Club on January 29, 1879 John Butler, another Ningbo missionary, gave an account of “Modern Putuo”:</p> <p>Modern Putuo begins with the era of rebuilding, on a large and permanent scale, and this era has commenced within the last ten years. While the fear of pirates hovered around the island, the priests were chary to bring forward their buried wealth and Buddhism appeared as dead. Now that merchant steamers are daily passing back and forth in sight of its shores, and gunboats, native and foreign make frequent visits to its waters, the fears of the priests have been quieted, and there is a simultaneous movement all over the island, to repair the old temples and to build new ones.<sup id="ftn43:ref"><a href="#ftn43">43</a></sup></p> <p>Later Butler again remarks on the role of steamships in the development of shipping routes to Putuo:</p> <p>I have been so struck with this appearance of revival and activity that I have enquired of some of the oldest priests on the island, the cause, and all give the same reasons, viz., a sense of security that their buildings will not be burned nor their contents rifled, and this security and immunity from danger, is the result of foreign commerce and civilization, in driving pirates from the seas, and introducing the era of steam into Chinese waters.<sup id="ftn44:ref"><a href="#ftn44">44</a></sup></p> <p>Thus it seems to Butler that Buddhism on Mount Putuo, which appeared to its Western visitors to have fallen on hard times all by itself, was now rescued by the arrival of “foreign commerce and civilization.” A truly amazing conclusion, and in its lack of reflection, contrition, and shame in line with Western attitudes for a century and more to come.</p></section><div class="section-divider__SectionDividerContainer-sc-194f6qw-0 fLOyln"><span></span><span></span></div></div><div class="article__Footnotes-pcvbzg-2 ggOfAV"><ol><li id="ftn1"><p>I am grateful to Professor Katsufumi Narita and the Graduate School of International Development at Nagoya University, for hosting me as Visiting Research Fellow in Fall 2015, where much of the research for this paper took place.
